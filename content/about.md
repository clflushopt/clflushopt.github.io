I am a Senior Software Engineer working on data infrastructure and based in Canada, I like to build
software and contribute back to OSS. I maintain [tpchgen-rs](https://github.com/clflushopt/tpchgen-rs) and
contribute to [Datafusion](https://github.com/apache/datafusion).

I often work on experimental and research projects like [SIGMOD contest problems](https://github.com/clflushopt/sigmod-2025),
investigating [how CPUs behave](https://github.com/clflushopt/uarch-xyz) and [all](https://github.com/clflushopt/llvm-riscv-lifter) [sorts](https://github.com/clflushopt/coldbrew)
of [compilers](https://github.com/clflushopt/icepop).

In a previous life I worked on implementing cryptography libraries and numerical solvers in C++.
