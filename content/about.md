# About Me

I am a Senior Software Engineer working on data platforms and infrastructure based in Canada.

I am very much a π-shaped engineer who likes to investigate and work across the entire software stack
from tinkering with network drivers to rolling my own crypto. But my preferred domain is databases
specifically Query Optimization and Execution and also somewhat of compilers nerd.

I like to contribute to opensource software like [tpchgen-rs](https://github.com/clflushopt/tpchgen-rs) and [Datafusion](https://github.com/apache/datafusion).

Outside my open-source work, I often work on experimental and research projects like working on
[SIGMOD contest problems](https://github.com/clflushopt/sigmod-2025), investigating [CPU behavior](https://github.com/clflushopt/uarch-xyz)
or working on all kind of compilers like [JIT compilers](https://github.com/clflushopt/coldbrew)
or [emulators for fuzzing](https://github.com/clflushopt/icepop).

In a previous life I worked on implementing cryptography libraries and wrote numerical solvers in C++.
