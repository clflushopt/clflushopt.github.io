# About Me

I am a Senior Software Engineer working on data platforms and infrastructure based in Montreal, Quebec.
I like to describe myself as π-shaped with experience spanning multiple programming languages and fields
but my preferred domains are databases (Query Optimization and Execution) and software security and performance.

Currently, I work on maintaining [tpchgen-rs](https://github.com/clflushopt/tpchgen-rs) a blazing fast, Rust
native, TPC benchmarking toolkit and contributing to [Datafusion](https://github.com/apache/datafusion).

Outside my open-source work, I often work on experimental and research projects like
[microarchitecture security](https://github.com/clflushopt/uarch-xyz), [JIT compilation for (dynamic) languages](https://github.com/clflushopt/coldbrew)
[JIT compilation for software emulators](https://github.com/clflushopt/icepop).

In a previous life I worked on implementing high performance finite field and elliptic curve
arithmetic in C99, designed and implemented high performance numerical solvers in C++.

I also worked on reverse engineering and building and shipping machine learning models for
malware analysis as an ex-contributor to Saferwall.

Currently, I spend most of my time working on databases and database adjacent fields for example
I have (unregistered) designed and implemented a high performance main-memory join algorithm for
the SIGMOD 2025 contest.

Outside programming, I like to spend time reading, paddling with my dragon boat team and playing CTFs.

## Experience

### Optable

Senior Software Engineer | Feb, 2022 - Current.

Working on several internal project as a member of the platforms team.

## Languages

I am proficient in Go, Rust and Java with over 50,000 lines of code written in each - I am comfortable
working with C++, Scala, Python and OCaml and also spent my fair share with Bash, Ruby, HTML and Javascript.

## Infrastructure, Cloud and Systems.

I'am fairly knowledgable of the cloud native infrastructure stack such as K8s (Kubernetes), Docker, Terraform
and Helm. I've architected, deployed and managed infrastructure for data platforms handling close to a petabyte
of data.

Using my experience from playing CTFs I've become adept at understanding black box systems and designing the kind
of experiments to truly understand the performance and scalability behaviors of systems under load.

For example I've worked extensively with Google Cloud and became familiar with the scalability and behavior under
load of several of their products such as PubSub e.g. managing throughput vs latency, Bigtable e.g. effects of writes on reads and key partitioning and
BigQuery e.g. low level storage API, the behavior of the query optimizer, how to write queries to offset scan costs
and such.


## Education

### Ecole Polytechnique, Universiapolis.

**MSc in Computer Engineering** | 2019-2022 

Took courses in compilers, database systems, software design and many others, but I am most proud
of my MSc thesis which focused on fine-tuning LLMs (before they were cool) for the task of taking
contextual questions about a dataset and constructing the SQL queries that would answer them.

Of course nowadays this is a solved problem (ask Claude or ChatGPT).

### Faculty of Science and Technology, Settat.

**BSc in Mathematics**          | 2015-2019

Took courses in pure and applied mathematics, notably my thesis focused on the framework of differential
forms in physics. If I were to summarize it I would say "Cohomology is everywhere in physics."
