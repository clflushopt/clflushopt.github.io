This is one of those software and programming blogs; it's title was uninspiredly
stolen from one of my favorite [talks](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat "WAT by Gary Bernhardt")
of all time.

I mainly write long-form technincal deep dives into things I encountered on
my personal research projects that often involve databases or compilers or a bit
of both more often that not written in Rust.

You can find most of my projects in my [Github](https://github.com/clflushopt).
